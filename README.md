## This e-commerce was built with React to practice core concepts like:

### ⚛️ State Management

Used **useState** for local component state.

Implemented **useContext** to share global cart state (like items, quantities, and total price) across components.

### 🌐 Routing

Integrated **React Router** for seamless navigation.

### 🎨 UI/UX Focus

Designed an intuitive interface.

Emphasized clean, reusable components.

### ⚙️ Key Features:

Add/remove items from cart.

Adjust quantities with +/- buttons.

Auto-updating total price.

### 👩🏽‍💻 Learning Outcomes:

Strengthened React fundamentals (hooks, context API).

Practiced prop drilling avoidance with global state.

Gained confidence in building dynamic UIs.
